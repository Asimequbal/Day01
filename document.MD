Sure, I can explain this piece of code. It is written in **JavaScript**, a scripting language that allows you to create dynamic and interactive web pagesÂ¹. Here is what each line of code does:

- `const panels = document.querySelectorAll('.panel')`: This line declares a constant variable named `panels` and assigns it the value of a **NodeList** object that contains all the elements in the document that have the class name `panel`. A NodeList is a collection of nodes that can be accessed by index, like an arrayÂ².
- `panels.forEach(panel => { ... })`: This line uses the `forEach` method of the NodeList object to loop through each element in the `panels` variable and execute a function for each one. The function takes one parameter, `panel`, which represents the current element in the loopÂ².
- `panel.addEventListener('click', () => { ... })`: This line uses the `addEventListener` method of the Element object to attach a **click event** listener to the current panel element. The second parameter of this method is a function that defines what to do when the panel is clicked. In this case, the function is an **arrow function**, which is a shorter way of writing a function expressionÂ³.
- `removeActiveClasses()`: This line calls a function named `removeActiveClasses`, which is defined later in the code. This function removes the `active` class from all the panel elements, as we will see below.
- `panel.classList.add('active')`: This line uses the `classList` property of the Element object to access the list of class names of the current panel element. Then it uses the `add` method of the DOMTokenList object to add the `active` class to the panel. This will change the appearance of the panel according to the CSS rules that apply to the `active` class.
- `function removeActiveClasses() { ... }`: This line defines the function that we saw earlier. It takes no parameters and returns nothing.
- `panels.forEach(panel => { ... })`: This line is similar to the one we saw before, except that it loops through the `panels` variable again and executes a different function for each panel element.
- `panel.classList.remove('active')`: This line uses the `classList` property and the `remove` method of the DOMTokenList object to remove the `active` class from the current panel element. This will restore the original appearance of the panel according to the CSS rules.

The purpose of this code is to create a simple **accordion** effect, where clicking on a panel expands it and collapses the other panels. You can see a live demo of this code [here].

I hope this explanation was helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. ðŸ˜Š
